# GXF Core Library

The GXF Core library defines essential software components that are required to use GXF
in a consuming project:
- Base infrastructure, including:
  - The GXF entity/component model;
  - GXF resources;
  - GXF "expected" types;
  - Logging;
- Advanced infrastructure, including:
  - The GXF runtime;
  - The GXF C/C++ API.

The GXF Core library is tightly coupled with the [GXF Standard Extension](../std/README.md).
