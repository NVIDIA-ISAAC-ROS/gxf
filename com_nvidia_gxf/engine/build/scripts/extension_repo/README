### Usage
The following command creates the boiler plate code to track the latest release branch in GXF core repo.

python3 create_extension_repo.py -s sample -n Sample -o '/tmp/sample'

The new repo also has a few helper scripts to
* install all dependencies for the repo
* toolchain and build infra needed to compile the extension for various platforms (See GXF Core repo readme for build configs)
* deploying apps on remote target devices

To deploy a sample application on a remote device:
./build/scripts/gxf/deploy.sh -p <nv_gxf_app-target>-pkg -d <device_config> -h <jetson_ip>  --remote_user <jetson_uname> -b bazel
