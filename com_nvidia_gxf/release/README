Example command to build and use a release package:
1) Build using a command similar to below. tmp/packaging can be replaced for a more convenient location, if needed.
python3 release/make_tarball.py release/tarball_content.yaml release_tarball /tmp/packaging/

2) Extract the release_tarball generated in the previous step
tar -xvf release_tarball --directory /

The step above places the release package in /tmp/packaging directory.

3) Make sure that the dependencies are installed/setup correctly. The following are sample paths for gxf_core and gxe.
$update-alternatives --query gxf_core

Name: gxf_core
Link: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgxf_core.so
Status: auto
Best: /opt/nvidia/graph-composer/libgxf_core.so
Value: /opt/nvidia/graph-composer/libgxf_core.so

Alternative: /opt/nvidia/graph-composer/libgxf_core.so
Priority: 50

$ update-alternatives --query gxe
Name: gxe
Link: /usr/bin/gxe
Status: auto
Best: /opt/nvidia/graph-composer/gxe
Value: /opt/nvidia/graph-composer/gxe

Alternative: /opt/nvidia/graph-composer/gxe
Priority: 50

4) Run the <release_build_installation_path/release>release_build_setup.sh

5) The release package (installed in /tmp/packaging in the case described) is ready to be used now.
